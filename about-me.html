        <h1>How did I become a Web Developer?</h1>
    
        <p>Since I was a child, technology and visual composition have been my great interests. At 14, I launched my first blog, where I began to experiment and connect with the digital world by sharing resources and writingâ€”a passion that has always accompanied me. In 2019, I enrolled in a Bachelor's degree in Languages and Audiovisual Media, where, alongside cinema, I confirmed my appreciation for color and visual compositions. In 2021, cinema became an integral part of my life from a new perspective, initiating a journey of exploration that led me through various fields, such as teaching Spanish, nutrition, ceramics, and, of course, tea.</p>
    
        <p>Tea has been a constant in my life since childhood, connecting me with my family around tables filled with conversations and special moments. In 2024, I rediscovered my passion for technology and began my training in web development at JaP, finally feeling aligned with my true path. Recently, I have also discovered my passion for music, another art that guides my life.</p>
        
        <p>Now, as a web developer, I continually seek to improve my skills and push myself further. I have always been driven by art and have a constant interest in self-discovery and developing tools that fit my lifestyle. I approach challenges with a mindset of learning and growth, always looking for ways to evolve and enrich my knowledge.</p>
